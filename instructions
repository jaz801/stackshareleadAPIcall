You need to get the API key

Their UX is terrible, but next to 100 API call, which should say 100 API endpoints, you find a dot.
Click on it and then agree.

First test the script with the 100 API endpoints if the Count Script works, upgrade to the paid tier. 

How this GRAPH API works -> You retrieve 25 leads for each call, and each call has an idenitfier for the next call.

40 * 25 = 1000 leads. 



Run these script in Google Colab

First run the Count Script
Secondly, run the Get The End Point Script
Thirdly, run the the get the 1000 leads script
